This project is a simple quote-serving JSON API using Express. Last month, I set out to learn node.js by building a barebones node http server and for this project I decided to use Express to build out web api.

## Acknowledgements

For this project, I want to thank [Kam Lasater](https://github.com/seekayel) for reaching out to me. He informed me about his project [Cyclic.sh](Cyclic.sh) and allowed me to deploy with a few clicks. It is great that developers like Kam can make this complex world of coding easier for someone like me.
